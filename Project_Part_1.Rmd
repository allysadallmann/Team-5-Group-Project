## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
dataset <- read.csv("ai4i2020.csv") %>% data.frame()
dataset
```


```{r}
dataset %>% mutate(difference = Process.temperature..K.-Air.temperature..K.) %>% 
  filter(difference<8.6 & Tool.wear..min.>200 & Tool.wear..min.<240)
  
```


```{r}
means <- dataset %>% summarize(twf_failure = mean(TWF)*100, 
                      hdf_failure = mean(HDF)*100,
                      pwf_failure = mean(PWF)*100,
                      osf_failure = mean(OSF)*100,
                      rnf_failure = mean(RNF)*100)
means

means %>% ggplot() + geom_bar(aes, stat = "summary", fun = "mean")
```


```{r}
prop_failures <- dataset %>% 
  select(TWF, HDF, PWF, OSF, RNF) %>% 
  summarize_all(mean) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(aes(name, value, fill=name), stat='identity') + theme_classic() +
  ylab('Proportion of failures') + xlab('Type of failure') + theme(legend.position='none')
