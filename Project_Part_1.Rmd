## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
dataset <- read.csv("ai4i2020.csv") %>% data.frame()
str(dataset)
```


```{r}
prop_failures <- dataset %>% 
  select(TWF, HDF, PWF, OSF, RNF) %>% 
  summarize_all(mean) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(aes(name, value, fill=name), stat='identity') + theme_classic() +
  ylab('Proportion of failures') + xlab('Type of failure') + theme(legend.position='none') +ggtitle('Proportion of failures by Type')

prop_failures

```
